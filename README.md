# AI-Generated Text Detection using BERT With Researsh Paper

## Overview
An NLP system that detects whether a given text is AI-generated or human-written
using a fine-tuned BERT model. The project focuses on building an end-to-end
machine learning pipeline with real-world evaluation and backend integration.

## Tech Stack
